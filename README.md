This is NCQA's and Firely's official support SDK for working with [CQL][cql-spec] on the Microsoft .NET (dotnet) platform.

## Release notes ##
This software is in alpha phase. Any part of the public interface can (and will) change as we prepare the library for its 1.0 release. Read the releases notes
